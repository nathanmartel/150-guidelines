<h2 class="margin-top-50">The Legend of the Wolf and Kettle</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-9">
        <p class="body intro">Many years ago, in the Basque country of Spain, there lived a prosperous and generous family who, after feeding family, retainers, and soldiers, had enough left over to feed even the wild animals. To commemorate this act of generosity, a carving of two wolves eating at a cauldron (above) was placed over the lintel of the family’s home in Loyola, Spain.</p>
        <p class="body intro"> Many centuries later, St. Ignatius of Loyola would be born into this family and would go on to establish the Jesuit order and change the world. Today, we celebrate this fundamental act of generosity, which has become the heraldic shield of the Loyola family, the symbol of this University, and a fitting tribute to Loyolans and the spirit of generosity that makes all possible.</p>
